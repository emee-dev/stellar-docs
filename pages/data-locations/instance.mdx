# Usage of the Instance Storage

Instance storage in Soroban is similar to persistent storage,
with a key distinction: it has an archival Time-To-Live (TTL) tied to the contract instance itself.
This means that as long as the contract remains active, the data stored in instance
storage is guaranteed to be available.

Instance storage is particularly beneficial for storing global contract data that
is accessed or modified by multiple users, such as an administrator address in a token contract.
This centralized storage ensures that critical contract-wide information is consistently accessible.

```rust copy

#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, contracttype, Address, Env};

#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    Admin,
}

#[contract]
pub struct Contract;

#[contractimpl]
impl Contract {
    // Checks if an administrator has been set in the contract
    pub fn is_admin_set(env: &Env) -> bool {
        let key = DataKey::Admin;
        env.storage().instance().has(&key)
    }

    // Retrieves the administrator's address from the contract
    pub fn get_admin(env: &Env) -> Address {
        let key = DataKey::Admin;
        env.storage().instance().get(&key).unwrap()
    }

    // Assigns a new administrator address in the contract
    pub fn set_admin(env: &Env, admin: Address) {
        let key = DataKey::Admin;
        env.storage().instance().set(&key, &admin);
    }
}

```
