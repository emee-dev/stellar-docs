# Usage of the Persistent Storage

Persistent storage is particularly useful for storing data that is unique to individual
users but needs to remain accessible across multiple interactions with the contract.
This type of storage is ideal for data that is not shared globally among all users,
such as user-specific balances or preferences, and is designed to be durable and not temporary.

In the example below, persistent storage is used to store and retrieve a
user's "favorite number," which is generated randomly and stored for future reference.

```rust copy

#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, contracttype, Address, Env};

#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    UserFavorite(Address),
}

#[contract]
pub struct UserFavoriteContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl UserFavoriteContract {
    // Generates a random number for the user, stores it as their favorite, and returns it
    pub fn set_random_favorite(env: Env, user: Address) -> u64 {
        let key = DataKey::UserFavorite(user);
        let favorite_number: u64 = env.prng().gen();
        env.storage().persistent().set(&key, &favorite_number);
        favorite_number
    }

    // Retrieves and returns the user's stored favorite number, or 0 if not set
    pub fn get_favorite(env: Env, user: Address) -> u64 {
        let key = DataKey::UserFavorite(user);
        if let Some(favorite_number) = env.storage().persistent().get(&key) {
            favorite_number
        } else {
            0
        }
    }
}

```
