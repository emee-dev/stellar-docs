# Visibility

The pub keyword in Rust, and consequently in Soroban smart contracts, indicates that the function is public and can be accessed both from within the module and from outside it. This visibility is essential for contract functions that are intended to be called by external users or other contracts.

Here's what pub visibility entails in a Soroban smart contract:

- External Access: Functions marked with pub can be called by external entities interacting with the contract. In the example, the hello function is public, meaning it can be invoked by anyone who has access to the contract on the blockchain.

- Internal Module Access: In addition to being accessible externally, pub functions can also be called from within the same module. This allows for flexible design where internal contract logic might reuse public functions.

- Contract Interface: Public functions are part of the contract's interface. When you deploy the contract, tools interacting with the Soroban network can discover and call these public functions, making them a key part of how the contract interacts with the outside world.

```rust copy

#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, vec, Env, Symbol, Vec};

#[contract]
pub struct HelloContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl HelloContract {
    pub fn public_function(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol_short!("Public"), to]
    }

    fn private_function(env: Env, to: Symbol) -> Vec<Symbol> {
        vec![&env, symbol_short!("Privy"), to]
    }
}

```
