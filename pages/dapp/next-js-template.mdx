# Next Js Template

## Overview

I am a lover of good technology and Next js is a good fullstack framework for building better React applications. I made this template to be a monorepo setup and with the
intention to reduce some of the code duplication.

## Requirements

- **Stellar CLI**: Required for deploying and interacting with Stellar smart contracts.
- **Node.js**: v16 or later.
- **pnpm**: Preferred package manager for this project.
- **Turborepo**: For managing the monorepo.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured in a `.env` file at the root of your project:

```bash
# Using Testnet network (worked last time I checked)
PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL="https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443"

SOROBAN_ACCOUNT="alice"
SOROBAN_NETWORK="testnet"
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/oss-donations-stellar.git
   cd oss-donations-stellar
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use pnpm to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Initialize the Project**:

   The `init.js` script handles the setup of smart contracts. Before starting the Next.js dApp, run the initialization script:

   ```bash
   pnpm run init
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:

   The contracts will be built and deployed to the testnet automatically by the `init.js` script. After deployment, TypeScript bindings will be generated for each contract.

5. **Run the dApp**:

   Start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

6. **Interact with Smart Contracts**:

   You can interact with the deployed smart contracts using the import contracts. Example:

   ```ts
   "use client";

   import oss_donate from "@/components/contracts/oss_donate";
   import { useEffect } from "react";

   async function contract_fn_call() {
     let client = await oss_donate.testing_fn();

     console.log(client.result);
   }

   useEffect(() => {
     contract_fn_call();
   }, []);
   ```

## Project Structure

- **/apps/dapp**: The Next.js frontend for the dApp.
- **/apps/dapp/components/contracts**: Contains the Imported Typescript Smart Contract Bindings.
- **/soroban**: Directory containing the smart contracts written in Rust.
- **/bindings**: Auto-generated TypeScript bindings workspaces for the smart contracts.
